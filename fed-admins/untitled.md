We screen everyone who wants to join the Federation Admins Squad. If you're a good fit, we'll invite you to enter our **Interview Chat**, where we can interview you and do some verification steps there. In rare cases, we can promote somebody who has an effort to report and ban spammers and also have experience in moderating chats.

## Do I need to join the Pins team if I want to be a FedAdmin?

Not really. Once you're now a FedAdmin, you'll have admin rights across our Community Hub Network in Telegram to help us moderate the chats.
