## Becoming an FedAdmin

{% hint style="warning" %}
## A word of warning before you apply.

Before joining, please take some time to visit this page for [valid ban reasons](https://en.handbooksbythepins.gq/community-hub/network-federation/fedban-reasons/). Also, if you want to join the team, please take some time to [read our handbook](https://en.handbooksbythepins.gq).
{% endhint %}

We screen everyone who wants to join the Federation Admins Squad. If you're a good fit, we'll invite you to enter our **Interview Chat**, where we can interview you and do some verification steps there. In rare cases, we can promote somebody who has an effort to report and ban spammers and also have experience in moderating chats.

### Joining the Pins team?

Not really. Once you're now a FedAdmin, you'll have admin rights across our Community Hub Network in Telegram to help us moderate the chats.
