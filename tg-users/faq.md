# FAQs for Users

## Appealing a ban

### Within the fed

Your ban reason may affect your chances of getting unbanned. Please consult [our list first](https://en.handbooksbythepins.gq/community-hub/network-federation/fedban-reasons) before asking for an unban. To start the process, join the Federation Support Chat, send `#appeal_to_ban` and follow the prompts.

### Outside the fed

If you come here to appeal to a ban that we don't have control, we might suggest contacting the designated Anti-spam Service Contact or join their support chat and ask for help.
